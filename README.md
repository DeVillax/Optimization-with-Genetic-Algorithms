# Optimization with Genetic Algorithms

Implementation of a genetic algorithm (GA) for the clustering of the nodes of a graph, by means of the optimization of modularity. This is my implementation of the fourth and last assigment of the "Neural and Evolutionary Computation" course of the MESIIA master, Universitat Rovira i Virgili.

## Objective

The objective of this last assignment is to optimize the arrangement of nodes into clusters of a network through the implementation of a genetic algorithm (GA). The parameter to be optimized is the modularity and this work aims to obtain the configuration that maximizes it.
